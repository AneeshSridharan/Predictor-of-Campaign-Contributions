# Predictor-of-Campaign-Contributions
Analysis of Election Campaign Contributions 2016

The 2016 presidential primaries have been full of surprises, and aside from votes, one can measure a candidates popularity by media coverage and funds raised by campaigns. The current primary season has focused a lot of attention on campaign finance reform and the media’s coverage of presidential candidates. Therefore, I was curious to see if a relationship existed between a candidate’s media coverage and campaign contributions.

A model was built to predict future campaign donations from the sentiment and quantity of articles published about candidates. New York Times’ headlines were analyzed for sentiment, and financial data was collected from the Federal Election Commission archives. Ultimately, I was unable to find a relationship between media sentiment and financial donations. Nevertheless, results suggest that a candidates ability to gain media exposure is related to their ability to generate funds.
